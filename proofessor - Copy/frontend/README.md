# Proofessor Frontend

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. (Optional) Set your backend API URL in `.env`:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=PUT_YOUR_BACKEND_URL_HERE
   ```
3. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Build for Production

npm run build
```

## Notes
- Make sure the app name is set to "Proofessor" in `package.json` and `public/index.html`.
- Update the API URLs in your code or `.env` as needed for deployment.
- Do **not** commit your `.env` file or secrets to GitHub.
